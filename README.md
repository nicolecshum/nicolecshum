### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a third-year Applied Statistics and Biological Sciences double major seeking opportunities to gain experience in data science and applied research. I have a strong interest in statistical data science, biotechnology, and biomedical research but am interested in all biological sciences. I am passionate, detail-oriented, and skilled at collaboration with coworkers alongside a strong work ethic and ability to be flexible. :smile:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skills with Python, R, and SQL, primarily at UC Davis, supplemented by online courses like Codecademy.
